This is a wallpaper site with the primary goal of allowing the grouping of images which can then be accessed through an webservice. The original use-case was to provide a way to easily change out the background of a dashboard app, but it could be applied to any application that would need to access images from a service rather than include the images in the application.

To test:
1. Start MySql server with <code>mamp start</code>.
2. Start the Apollo/Express server by running <code>npm run start</code> in the root directory.
3. Start the React client app by <code>cd client</code> and then running <code>npm run start</code>.
